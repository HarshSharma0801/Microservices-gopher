# Microservices gopher

This project is a Go-based microservices architecture for an e-commerce system, consisting of four independent services: User , Order, Payment, and Notification. The User Service handles user creation , while the Order Service manages order creation and updates. The Payment Service integrates with Stripe to process transactions, and the Notification Service sends email updates using SMTP.
